# The fibonacci sequence is a famous bit of mathematics, and it happens to
# have a recursive definition. The first two values in the sequence are
# 0 and 1 (essentially 2 base cases). Each subsequent value is the sum of the
# previous two values, so the whole sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21
# and so on. Define a recursive fibonacci(n) method that returns the nth
# fibonacci number, with n=0 representing the start of the sequence.

def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:

    else:
        return n + fibonacci(n-1)
